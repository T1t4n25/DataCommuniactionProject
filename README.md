# Welcome to CRC Simulation Algorithm

In this code, I implemented the CRC algorithm in the sender side and the CRC check in the reciever side, and a small bit flipping algorithm to simulate errors in the bits to trigger the CRC check and resend the bits again


## 2 python files
**1.** the **data.py** file contains the main CRC code and logic.

**2.** the **helper.py** file contains some functions that are necessary in the calculations but not necessary to the crc implementation like the modular 2 division and XOR.

### Feel free to use the code as you please without the need to credit or ask me for it, for whatever you'll ever want to do.
